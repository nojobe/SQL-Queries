customers. Title the column heading for the count of customers as “Customers”. (3)

the column heading for the count of orders as “OrderCount”.  (1)

ContactDate (DATE) and  OrderTotal (a decimal number with 9 digits in total having two decimal places).  
None of these columns can be NULL.  Include a PRIMARY KEY constraint named “TopCustomer_PK” on 
CustomerNumber. (no answer set) 
 
16. Populate the new table “TopCustomers” with the CustomerNumber, today’s date, and the total

greater than $140,000. (inserted 10 rows, no answer set)  

 
17. List the contents of the TopCustomers table in descending OrderTotal sequence. (10) 
 
18. Add a new column to the TopCustomers table called OrderCount (integer). (No answer set) 
 
19. Update the Top Customers table, setting the OrderCount column to a random number (from 0 to 18). 
(Should update 10 rows)  HINT:  use the RAND() and FLOOR() functions.  
 
20. List the contents of the TopCustomers table in descending OrderCount sequence. (10)
